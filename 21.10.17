yesterday i went to the college to collect my s7 and s8 certificate
as it was mandatory for it to be collected and submiited at the university,
to add the grace mark i obtained for securing a place in one of university sports event.
and due to that i was not able to study much

today i finaly was able to resolve my conectivity problem.
i re installed ubuntu,
i went onto read till the chapter "list" 
setting up git hub was really a pain as i encountered many problem due to the fact that i used git push in the older system and i have lost the data and the saved folder
done some exercises in chapter string, but was only succesful in obtaining output of the question 8.10

from tommrow onwards i'll be able to completly dedicate myself on to the task at hand

i am still trying to figure out how to post these updates. i will analyse other group members activity and find out clarity to my doubts as soon as possible
